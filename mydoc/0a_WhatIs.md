## 0.1.1 Basic Idea

As stated in the introduction this guide will teach you all the basics of Java. It's primarily geared towards beginners who have no prior programming experience. The guide is designed to be read through from start to finish with each new chapter building on the last, and by the end the amount that you learn should be roughly equivalent to that of an semester long college course. If you already have experience with Java you can also use it as a reference and skip to the part that you need (maybe you're in one of those college courses and you need some help :) ). For the rest of this page I'll be going through the ethos pathos and logos of why you should follow this guide. If you just want to jump into it you can go ahead and skip to Chapter 1. 

## 0.1.2 Why should you learn Java?

There are several reasons why you should learn Java. It's currently [the most popular language](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index) in the software industry, and because of this most colleges choose Java as the main languages to teach in their computer science program ( most of you are probably reading this because you're in one of those programs).

Another nice thing about Java is that it falls into a nice spot on the spectrum of language difficulty. When learning Java you'll need to understand more details about the logic than you would with languages such as Javascript or Python. At the same type you won't need to know as much as you would with C or C++ (Java doesn't support pointers). However when compared to those 4 languages Java is the most verbose, meaning that you have to type out a lot more to achieve the same outcome. For educational reasons I think this is very handy since you're constantly reminded about the concepts whereas in the other languages these details are buried in the syntax. So Java includes a decent amount of details and the language is designed in a way that these concepts are reenforced. 

## 0.1.3 Who am I?

I'm Arend Peter Castelein. I'm a student, studying Math and Computer Engineering, and I plan to be a software engineer when I graduate. I taught myself Java in high school back in 2010. Since then I've been using the language regulary. I've used it for school school projects, [my own projects](www.arendpeter.com), competitve programming problems and I've made occasional Java tutorials on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SynforgeTutorials). My goal for this guide is to allow you to learn the basics of Java in a painless manner, and even have fun while doing it.
