## 0.1.1 Basic Idea

As stated in the introduction this guide will teach you all the basics of Java. It's primarily geared towards beginners who have no prior programming experience. The guide is designed to be read through from start to finish with each new chapter building on the last, however if you already have experience with Java it can also be used as a reference. For the rest of this page I'll be going through the ethos pathos and logos of why you should learn Java and why you should use this resource specifically. If you just want to jump into it you can go ahead and skip to Chapter 1. 

## 0.1.3 Why should you learn Java?

There are several reasons why you should learn Java. It's currently [the most popular language](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index) in the software industry, and because of this most colleges choose Java as the main languages to teach in their computer science program ( most of you are probably reading this because you're in one of those programs).

Another nice thing about Java is that it falls into a nice spot on the spectrum of language difficulty.
