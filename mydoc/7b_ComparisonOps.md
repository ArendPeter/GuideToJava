## 7.2.1 Comparison Operators in conditions

The rest of the sections of this chapter cover different ways we can work with the condition of the if statement. After all, the condition is the core part of the if statement since this is the portion that decides which path the logic will take. It's important to remember that regardless of what symbols we add to the condition the end result is always that it becuase a true/false expression which we evaluate to decide which path we should take.

In this section we'll be covering the various comparison operators. Using these we can use our if statements to describe more complex logic. Here's an example of what we might do

```java
if()
```

## 7.2.2 List of comarison operators

Here are the list of comparison operators that you can use in Java along with their mathematical equivalent

| Java Syntax | Math Symbol  |
|:--------|:--------|
| ==    | \=  |
| !=   | ≠ |
| <=     | ≤ |
| <    | < |
| >=    | ≥ |
| >    | \> |

>**Note:** Just want to clarify that `==` and `=` are different. Remember that `=` is the assignment operator, so `a = b` will set `a` to be the same as `b`. `==` on the other hand won't change either side. `a == b` will be a true statement if `a` and `b` are the same, and otherwise it will be false.
