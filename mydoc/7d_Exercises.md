1. Scan the 3 side lengths of a triangle (we'll call them sides a,b,c and assume that they're ints), and print whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. Here are the definitions in case you don't remember them exactly:
 - Equilateral : All sides of the triangle are equal.
 - Isosceles : Two sides of the triangle are equal, but the third side is different.
 - Scalene : All sides of the triangle are different from each other.

2. You're putting a castle under siege. Take in the the variables wallHeight, ladderHeight, hasLadder, and hasCatapults, and determine if the castle can be taken. Here are the rules:
 - If you have a catapult, the castle can be taken.
 - If you have a ladder, and the ladder is tall enough to get to the top of the wall, then the castle can be taken.
